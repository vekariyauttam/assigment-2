10. Demonstrate how to replace a CPU fan in a desktop computer. 
ans :-step 1 - power off :-shutdown your computer and unplug the power cord and hold the power button for few seconds 
                           to discharge any electricity.

      step 2 - Open the Case :- Remove the side panel to access the CPU area.

      step 3 - Locate the CPU fan :- The CPU fan is usually located on top of the CPU which is covered by heatsink.

      step 4 - Disconnect the fan :- Disconnect the fan's power cable from the motherboard.
                                  :- It will be a small 3 or 4-pin connector labeled "CPU FAN".

      step 5 - Remove the old fan:- Carefully detach the fan from the heatsink.

      step 6 - Clean the CPU :- Use a lint-free cloth and isopropyl alcoholto remove any old
                                thermal paste from the top of the CPU and the bottom of the heatsink. 
      
      step-7 - Apply new thermal paste :- apply the small size of new thermal to the center of CPU.

      step 8 - install the new fan cooler :- Secure the new fan to the heatsink, ensuring it's properly aligned and making good contact.

      step 9 - Reconnect the fan :- Connect the new fan's power cable to the CPU fan on the motherboard.
     
      step 10 - Close the case :- Close the computer case,
                                  and again power on your computer,
                                  and check the new fan is working correctly,
                                  you can see the CPU tempraturen in the BIOS.


                                                                           aSection 5: Essay
